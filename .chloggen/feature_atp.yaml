  The Adaptive Telemetry Processor (ATP) is an intelligent metric filtering component that reduces telemetry costs by up to 70% while maintaining high observability during critical events.

  Key Features:
  - Metric threshold filtering for CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics
  - Process-based sampling with full path matching for security
  - Dynamic threshold adjustment based on historical baselines
  - Multi-metric composite scoring for holistic health assessment
  - Anomaly detection to capture sudden metric changes
  - Stateful processing with persistent JSON storage
  - Security hardening with restricted storage paths, symlink protection, and proper file permissions

  Configuration options include:
  - Configurable metric thresholds for system and process metrics
  - Dynamic threshold adjustment with exponential moving average smoothing
  - Composite scoring with configurable metric weights
  - Anomaly detection with configurable history size and change thresholds
  - Process filtering by full executable path (prevents process name spoofing)
  - Secure state file storage under /var/lib/nrdot-collector/ with automatic permission management
