## v0.142.2

### 🚀 New components 🚀

- `processor/adaptivetelemetry`: Added the Adaptive Telemetry Processor, which dynamically adjusts telemetry data based on real-time analysis to optimize performance and resource utilization. (#111, #137, #138, #139, #140, #142, #145, #146, #153, #158)
  The Adaptive Telemetry Processor (ATP) is an intelligent metric filtering component that reduces telemetry costs by up to 70% while maintaining high observability during critical events.
  
  Key Features:
  - Metric threshold filtering for CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics
  - Process-based sampling with full path matching for security
  - Dynamic threshold adjustment based on historical baselines
  - Multi-metric composite scoring for holistic health assessment
  - Anomaly detection to capture sudden metric changes
  - Stateful processing with persistent JSON storage
  - Security hardening with restricted storage paths, symlink protection, and proper file permissions
  
  Configuration options include:
  - Configurable metric thresholds for system and process metrics
  - Dynamic threshold adjustment with exponential moving average smoothing
  - Composite scoring with configurable metric weights
  - Anomaly detection with configurable history size and change thresholds
  - Process filtering by full executable path (prevents process name spoofing)
  - Secure state file storage under /var/lib/nrdot-collector/ with automatic permission management
  
  Related PRs:
  - #137: Consolidated process metrics into single process.atp metric
  - #138: Enhanced state management security controls
  - #139: Added support for zombie processes and fixed unmonitored metrics
  - #140: Added CODEOWNERS for ATP
  - #142: Removed LICENSING file and minor ATP fixes
  - #145: Fixed stage names (inclusion reason) flow
  - #146: Minor refactoring and fixes
  - #153: Remove 'processor' suffix from component type
  - #158: Support state file storage on windows

### 🎉 Initial Release 🎉

This is the initial release of the New Relic OpenTelemetry Collector Components fork.

This fork is based on OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib v0.140.0 and includes:
- Core collector components (nop receiver, nop exporter)
- Internal utilities for New Relic-specific functionality
- Testbed for integration testing

For the full upstream changelog, see the [OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/releases).
